                    Instructions:
                    Analyze the text to determine which sentences contain essential information.

                    Provide significant context or details crucial for understanding the text.
                    Avoid redundancy by excluding repeated information.
                    Retain the original wording and sentence structure from the input text. Do not rephrase, paraphrase, or summarize
                     unless it is needed to avoid redundancy and repetition.
                    Maintain any other important context provided within the section. 
                    Ensure that the extracted sentences are presented in their original order for coherence. Omit filler, background, 
                    or tangential information unless directly relevant to the important points.
                    The response should be single paragraph with all the points concatenated next to each other.

        The heading of the summary should be relevant to the document and capture what the document is about.
        High-Level Summary:
        Write a paragraph summarizing the document in 6â€“8 sentences. This should include what the document is about, its main 
        purpose, or what it intends to convey.
        Main Points:
        Create a section titled 'Main Points'. This followed by a list of numbered key points.
        For each key point of the document, write a subheading.
        Under each subheading, create a bullet-point list of subpoints.
        Each subpoint should explain the concept, method, or discussion in a way that readers can understand. Avoid merely 
        stating what is in the document or what it discusses; instead, provide insights or summaries that clarify the topic.
        Optional Definitions (for academic papers):
        If the document uses specialized or technical terms unfamiliar to most people, include a section titled 'Definitions'.
        Provide simple, concise definitions for key terms in a bullet-point format.
        Ensure that your markdown is properly formatted, concise, and clear. The summary should prioritize clarity and 
        readability, making the content accessible to readers who may not have the document.
